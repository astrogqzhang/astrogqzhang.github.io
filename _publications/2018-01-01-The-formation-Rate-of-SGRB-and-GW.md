In this paper, we study the luminosity function and formation rate of short gamma-ray bursts (sGRBs). First, we derive the \(E_p-L_p\) correlation using 16 sGRBs with redshift measurements and determine the pseudo redshifts of 284 Fermi sGRBs. Then, we use the Lynden-Bell c- method to study the luminosity function and formation rate of sGRBs without any assumptions. A strong evolution of luminosity \(L(z) \propto (1+z)^4.47\) is found. After removing this evolution, the luminosity function is \(\Psi(L)\propto L_0^{-0.29 \pm 0.01}\) for dim sGRBs and \(\psi (L)\propto L_0^{-1.07\pm 0.01}\) for bright sGRBs, with the break point \(8.26Ã— 10^{50} \)erg s\(^{-1}\). We also find that the formation rate decreases rapidly at \(z< 1\).0, which is different from previous works. The local formation rate of sGRBs is 7.53 events Gpc-3 yr-1. Considering the beaming effect, the local formation rate of sGRBs including off-axis sGRBs is {203.31}-135.54+1152.09 events Gpc-3 yr-1. We also estimate that the event rate of sGRBs detected by the advanced LIGO and Virgo is {0.85}-0.56+4.82 events yr-1 for an NS-NS binary.
