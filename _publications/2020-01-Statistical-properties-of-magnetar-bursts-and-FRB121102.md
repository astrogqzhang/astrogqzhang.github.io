In this paper, we present statistics of soft gamma repeater (SGR) bursts from SGR J1550-5418, SGR 1806-20, and SGR 1900+14 by adding new bursts from Kırmızıbayrak et al. detected with the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer. We find that the fluence distributions of magnetar bursts are well described by power-law functions with indices 1.84, 1.68, and 1.65 for SGR J1550-5418, SGR 1806-20, and SGR 1900+14, respectively. The duration distributions of magnetar bursts also show power-law forms. Meanwhile, the waiting time distribution can be described by a non-stationary Poisson process with an exponentially growing occurrence rate. These distributive features indicate that magnetar bursts can be regarded as a self-organizing critical process. We also compare these distributions with the repeating fast radio burst (FRB) 121102. The statistical properties of repeating FRB 121102 are similar with magnetar bursts, combining with the large required magnetic field ($B \geq 10^{14} G$) of neutron star for FRB 121102, which indicates that the central engine of FRB 121102 may be a magnetar.
